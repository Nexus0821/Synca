# Synca
A program I made to track statistics of your PC and display them above your head in VRChat. This uses VRChat's OSC system to use the chatbox.

# How to start Synca
download the latest release, and just start the application named `Synca.exe`.
the app will wait for VRChat to open, and once it does it will immediately start showing test above your head. (it should)
if it doesnt, make an issue and i'll look into it.
